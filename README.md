## Project Overview

Understanding the fertility window is crucial for women who are trying to conceive or avoid pregnancy. This repository provides a comprehensive approach to predicting fertility windows based on cycle data, physiological indicators, and machine learning models. The analysis leverages real or simulated cycle data to create accurate and interpretable predictions.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on fertility and menstrual cycle data
- Feature engineering to extract useful predictors for ovulation and fertility window
- Several machine learning models for classification and regression tasks related to fertility prediction
- Evaluation and comparison of different models
- Visualization of cycle patterns, predictions, and model performance
- Ready-to-use Jupyter Notebooks for full transparency and reproducibility

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aiyenigbacharles/Fertility-Window.git
   cd Fertility-Window
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the analysis and modeling process.

---

## Usage

- Run the Jupyter Notebooks to follow the data analysis, feature engineering, and model training processes.
- Modify the input data or experiment with different features to improve the fertility window prediction.
- Use the trained models (if available) to predict fertility windows for new data.

---

## Model Details

- Models may include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and/or neural networks.
- Feature engineering considers cycle length, ovulation indicators, and other physiological data.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC (for classification) are provided.

---

## Results & Visualizations

- The notebooks include visualizations of menstrual cycles, feature importance, prediction probabilities, and model performance comparisons.
- Interpretations and recommendations based on model results are discussed within the notebooks.
